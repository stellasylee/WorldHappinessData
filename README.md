## Research Question
How does a country’s happiness score get influenced by the following factors:
   * GDP per capita- GDP per capita allows for higher purchasing power, which should be linked to higher happiness
   * Life Expectancy- Less sickness and death should be linked to higher happiness
   * Trust in the government- Greater trust in the country’s political environment should indicate higher happiness
   * Region - We want to explore if certain regions are more prone to happiness than others
   * Year- We were wondering if countries improve their residents’ happiness over time.
